_Component-Oriented Design and Architecture_

### Objectives

Assignment
[DesignLab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Mo6Uok0on9SDJiX1V2c1p6MjQ/view?resourcekey=0-AQPbiC3vPCzRQgqN-XZ0Bw)
will elaborate on the design and architecture of the component-oriented Asteroids game.
The overall objective is to make the Asteroids game component-based and to demonstrate reduced coupling that makes the
game less resistive to changes.

### Classwork

- Perform a dependency analysis (see the textbook example) on The Monolithic Asteroids Game
  [IntroLab](https://github.com/nymann/IntroLab) and The Asteroids Game [JavaLab](https://github.com/nymann/JavaLab).
- Reflect on what influence Component-oriented Design has on large systems.
